# Order Reconstruction: For each unique order (client_order_id), reconstruct its complete lifecycle by:
# Identifying all related events (updates and executions) from the order_events table
# Sorting them chronologically by event_time
# Detecting anomalies such as:
# Missing NEW status (orders that start with PARTIALLY_FILLED or FILLED)
# Out-of-order status transitions (e.g., CANCELLED â†’ PARTIALLY_FILLED)
# Duplicate status updates
# Time-travel (events with timestamps out of sequence)
